# Wayland Binary Clock
This is a toy project for learning Wayland and the first graphical project I've ever written.

The `wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1` rust skeleton code is from
https://github.com/PurestAsh/wayland_hello_world_rust (https://bbs.deepin.org/post/280508)

It should show a 96x64 B/W widget.
